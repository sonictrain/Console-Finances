## Description
This project aims to create JavaScript code designed for analyzing a company's financial records. The code processes a two-dimensional array formatted as demonstrated in the following example:
```JavaScript
finances = [
  ['MMM-YYYY', Number],
  ['MMM-YYYY', Number],
  ...
  ['MMM-YYYY', Number]
]
```
and it effectively tracks the following parameters within the financial data:
- Total Months Analyzed
- Profit and Loss (P&L)
- Average Change
- Greatest Increase (Date and Amount)
- Greatest Decrease (Date and Amount)
